\subsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains classes to run cooperatively scheduled tasks in a multitasking system. 

Tasks are created as descendents of {\ttfamily class} {\ttfamily Co\+Task}, with the user overriding the {\ttfamily run()} method of {\ttfamily Co\+Task} and the {\ttfamily ready()} method if appropriate. References to all the tasks to be run in the system are kept in a list maintained by class {\ttfamily Co\+Task\+List}; the system scheduler then runs the tasks\textquotesingle{} {\ttfamily run()} methods according to a chosen scheduling algorithm such as round-\/robin or highest-\/priority-\/first.
