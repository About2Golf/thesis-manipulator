\hypertarget{index_purpose}{}\subsection{Purpose}\label{index_purpose}
This software is intended to control a turret with pan and tilt functionality. A user interface will communicate with the board to give commands. The board runs the cotask rtos which implements the timing for each of out tasks. \hypertarget{index_usage}{}\subsection{Usage}\label{index_usage}
This scheduler runs an I\+MU, an encoder, two motors, and nerf gun motor drive, and a mastermind hub simultaneously using a cotask class. The motors and encoders are run through a user interface that just needs any key to be pressed. The motor, encoder, and I\+MU task function are used to control each task. \hypertarget{index_testing}{}\subsection{Testing}\label{index_testing}
Extensive Testing was performed on the design \hypertarget{index_bugs}{}\subsection{Bugs\+\_\+\&\+\_\+\+Limitations}\label{index_bugs}
Software wise there are no known bugs. Mechanically there is an issue with setscrew gear/shaft slip of the pan axis. \hypertarget{index_location}{}\subsection{Location\+\_\+of\+\_\+\+Source\+\_\+\+Code}\label{index_location}
