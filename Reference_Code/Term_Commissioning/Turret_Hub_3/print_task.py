## @file print_task.py
#  This file contains code for a task which prints things from a queue. It
#  helps to reduce latency in a system having tasks which print because it
#  sends things to be printed out the serial port one character at a time,
#  even when other tasks put whole strings into the queue at once. When run
#  as a low-priority task, this allows higher priority tasks to interrupt
#  the printing between characters, even when all the tasks are being 
#  cooperatively scheduled with a priority-based scheduler. 
#
#    Example code:
#    @code
#    # In each module which needs to print something:
#    import print_task
#
#    # In the main module or wherever tasks are created:
#    shares.print_task = print_task.PrintTask (name = 'Printing', 
#        buf_size = 100, thread_protect = True, priority = 0)
#    cotask.task_list.append (shares.print_task)
#
#    # In a task which needs to print something:
#    shares.print_task.put ('This is a string')
#    shares.print_task.put_bytes (bytearray ('A bytearray'))
#    @endcode
